This is a practice project written with Snack. 

You can play the game by pressing the input form and type any number between 1-99. Then click confirm button, press "Start." The computer generates a random number so if the number is lower than the number you typed at the biggining press "Greater" and if it's the other way around press "Lower." When the computer successfuly guess the number you typed the gameover screen will be shown together with the number of guess it took to reach the answer. Enjoy!
